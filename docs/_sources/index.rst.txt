Mutation Spectrum History Inference
###################################

``mushi`` is a Python package for nonparametric coalescent inference of demographic
history and mutation spectrum history (MuSH) from genomic variation data.
Both demographic history and MuSH are encoded in sample allele frequency
spectra as joint inverse problems, and ``mushi`` uses fast optimization methods
to infer these histories from data without model specification.
